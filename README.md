# International_Sales_Dashboard
I'm excited to share the completion of a dynamic project analyzing sales data for the International Sales Dashboard, submitted for the Data Analytics. 

Problem Statement:
The International Sales Dashboard provided sales and order data, including information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees. The objective was to build a top-level KPI dashboard to help executives quickly understand the company's performance in key areas.

2. The shipping company United Package contributed the most, accounting for 42.15% of the shipping goods, followed by Federal Shipping and Speedy Express.

3.   The most sold product is “Côte de Blaye,” followed by “Thüringer Rostbratwurst," “Raclette Courdavault,” and “Camembert Pierrot.”.

4. The most active employee who contributed to most sales is Margaret Peacock, followed by Janet Leverling, Nancy Davolio, and Andrew Fuller.
